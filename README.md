# Forest Pattern Maker

[![donate button](https://i.imgur.com/8WT0qBO.png)](https://paypal.me/peinorsm)

A program that helps plan forest patterns for people who have used the app, I still leave the link to the app [here](forestapp.cc)

## Requirements:
I used for the project only python 3.10 but you may assume newer functions compatible with Pygame will work.\

The modules are:
- Pygame
- JSON
- OS

To install run

```
git clone https://github.com/remeedev/forest-pattern-maker.git
```

Run the program files and if it tells you a module is missing the command to install is

```
pip install <module_name>
```

but I am pretty sure it will only ask for pygame.

## Functions:

1. create patterns by painting on the grid
2. live preview of how the patterns would look on forest app
3. image translator to pattern, in the images.py file
4. plant order given by the order.py file
